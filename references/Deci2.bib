abstract = "Investigated the effects of external reinforcement on intrinsic motivation in a puzzle-solving task in 96 undergraduates. Results support previous findings that money decreases intrinsic motivation while verbal reinforcements tend to enhance it. The beginning of a cognitive evaluation theory is discussed. It is concluded that although there is an apparently discrepant prediction between this theory and J. Adam's inequity theory, the theories are not conceptually discrepant. (15 ref.)",
